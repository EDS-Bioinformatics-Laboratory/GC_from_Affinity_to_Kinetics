# Software
This repository includes codes and nesseccary files for runing simulatios. The Agent-based model is based on [Meyer-Hermann et al., 2012] and [Robert et al., 2017].

Different scenarios can be modelled by codes provided in different folders:
   SC0: The Reference Scenario in the manuscript
   SC1: Scenario-1 in the manuscript
   SC2: SCenario-2 in the manuscript

All software is written in C++. All the parameters used are borrowed from the original model [Meyer-Hermann et al., 2012] except parameter $\theta$ that is explained in the manuscript. To change the parameters, use parameters.cpp

### Run simulations   
Run simulations Unix-based systems using following steps
qmake `KONKOFF.pro` 
make
run ./KONKOFF </br>
 
#### Options 
 -s "random seed" 
 -o "Path of output folder"
